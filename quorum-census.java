// Quorum census is a technique that can be used to ensure that a distributed system has reached consensus on a given value. It works by requiring a certain number of nodes (the "quorum") to agree on the value before it is accepted as the consensus.

// To implement quorum census in Java, you can use a distributed database or a distributed key-value store with quorum-based read and write operations. For example, you could use Apache Cassandra or Apache Zookeeper, which both support quorum-based read and write operations.

// Here is an example of how you might use Apache Cassandra to implement quorum census in Java:


import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.CqlSession;
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.cql.ResultSet;
import com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.cql.Row;

// Connect to the Cassandra cluster
CqlSession session = CqlSession.builder()
    .addContactPoint(new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 9042))
    .build();

// Set the consistency level to QUORUM
session.execute("USE mykeyspace");
session.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS values (key text PRIMARY KEY, value text)");
session.execute("INSERT INTO values (key, value) VALUES ('key1', 'value1') USING CONSISTENCY QUORUM");

// Read the value with a QUORUM consistency level
ResultSet resultSet = session.execute("SELECT * FROM values WHERE key='key1' USING CONSISTENCY QUORUM");
Row row = resultSet.one();
String value = row.getString("value");
System.out.println(value);

// In this example, we use the Cassandra Java driver to connect to a Cassandra cluster and create a keyspace and table. We then insert a value into the table using a consistency level of QUORUM, which requires a quorum of nodes to agree on the insertion before it is accepted. Finally, we read the value back from the table using a consistency level of QUORUM, which ensures that we receive the latest, most up-to-date value.

// This is just one example of how you can implement quorum census in Java using a distributed database. There are many other options and configurations available, so you may want to consult the documentation for your chosen database or key-value store for more information.
